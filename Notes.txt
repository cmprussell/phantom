RadCoolTest_v1:
-- galcen setup
-- cooling values chosen such that only one hydro timestep should occur per output time
-- various output durations (varying dtmax) so that cooling to the floor temperature is done over a varying number of steps
-- cooling not corrected, so this is the original exact_cooling subroutine that has the error of not finding the new k (i.e. has the error of not finding k')

RadCoolTest_v1b
-- same as RadCoolTest_v1 with with the cooling error fixed (i.e. finds the new k')

Test code: for me, this didn't work.  What did work was splitting the commands into two, which is presented as an alternative method in the Phantom docs.
make SYSTEM=ifort test

Test code: this did work
0. go to the correct firectory
<cd to /phantom/ top-level directory>
1. compile the test suite
make SYSTEM=ifort SETUP=test phantomtest
2. run the test suite in a slurm job
sbatch threads_TestSuite.qs

Run bots for code formatting -- this way the bot doens't fix the spacing/alignment/etc of your code, thereby removing you as the author in "blame"
0. add "findent" to the path; go to the scripts directory
export PATH="$PATH:/home/1024/findent-4.3.3/bin/bin"
cd scripts/
1. run the bot, capturing the output in a file
./bots.sh > output_v2b_bots.sh.txt

Pulling in changes from Daniel's upstream/master branch into my version, specifically to my branch main
1. git fetch upstream master
2. git chechout main -- not necessary if already on my branch named main
3. git merge upstream/master
4. use vi to fix merge issues.  Here is a sample output of step 3, which shows files that merged correctly and ones that we need me to manually fix.
   [(phys:crussell)@login01.caviness phantom]$ git merge upstream/master
   Auto-merging src/main/utils_gr.f90

   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
In this instance, I use vi to fix the issues in substepping.F90 and initial.f90
5. test the compilation status of the new changes
6. Do the git add, git commit, git push sequence so these changes are stored for my copy of the code

Make a new directory and compile the code
../../scripts/writemake.sh galcen > Makefile
make SYSTEM=ifort
make SYSTEM=ifort setup

make a new branch with the current branch's code; here, the new branch is named "multiAbu"
1a. git checkout -b multiAbu
make a new branch with a non-current branch's code; here, the new branch is named "branchNew" and the old/copied branch is "branchOld"
1b. git checkout -b branchNew branchOld
make the newly created branch tacked in your github local respository; here, the new branch is named "multiAbu"
2. git push origin multiAbu

Undo the very last thing done to a particular branch, which in this case was merging a pull request
1. git reset --hard HEAD~1
Update the branch so the remote repository has the undone changes -- note: since "-f" means force, this comes with a warning to only do this if you are sure this should be done (perhaps there is a better way I'll find in the future)
2. git push -f

Investigate changes among branches (here between branch main and branch multiAbu): list changed files only
1a. git diff --name-only main multiAbu
Investigate changes among branches (here between branch main and branch multiAbu): investighate changes within each file
1b. git diff main multiAbu


Pull in changes to a specific non-main branch once a pull request has updated a non-main branch (in this case, branch multiAbu)
1. git pull origin multiAbu
